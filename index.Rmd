This is a test using baby name popularity over time. 

The most popular name of 2013 was **`r most_popular_name_2013`**

wow how cool

there was also a function written to find the most popular name of any year, 
below is an example of that function with the year 2000

``` {r test, echo = FALSE}
most_popular_in_year_2000 = most_popular_in_year(2000)
print(most_popular_in_year_2000)
```

below is another function that did things

``` {r another_test, echo = FALSE}
n = number_in_million("Laura", 2013)
print(n)
```
